# ✨ Module 0 – Before You Start

Before diving into the world of AI & ML, it's important to have your development environment ready and strengthen your foundational knowledge.

In this module, we’ll focus on:
- Installing Python and a code editor
- Setting up essential Python packages
- Understanding why math is key to machine learning

A solid grasp of **Python programming** and **applied mathematics** (especially linear algebra, matrices, and probability) will help you understand how intelligent systems actually work under the hood.
