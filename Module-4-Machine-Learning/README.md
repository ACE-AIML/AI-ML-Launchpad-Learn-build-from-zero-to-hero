#  Module 4 – Machine Learning

Now that you understand data, it’s time to **teach machines how to learn from it**.

**Machine Learning (ML)** is the science of creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions — **without being explicitly programmed**. Yep, that’s as cool as it sounds.

This module introduces the basics of ML, recommended beginner-to-intermediate courses, and resources to get you hands-on with model training.
