#  Module 10 – Agentic AI

Welcome to the frontier of AI — **Agentic AI**! These intelligent agents are capable of planning, reasoning, and autonomously interacting with tools, APIs, and environments to achieve complex goals.

In this module, you'll explore how tool-using agents power dynamic, multi-step workflows — from executing research tasks to building entire software systems without constant human intervention.
